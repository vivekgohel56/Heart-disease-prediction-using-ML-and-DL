# Heart-disease-prediction-using-ML-and-DL
In this notebook first, simply I had performed Data exploration and also divide the data into train and validation to test performance. 
second, I had performed data analysis in that I had count positive and negative samples with the help of seaborn after that histogram and correlation matrix in data analysis and then I had done model building in this I had performed 4 ML algos and NN  and I had also done hyperparameter optimization with that I had got 90% accuracy in logistic regression and 90% accuracy in random-forest  with the help of Bayesian optimization and I had got 90% accuracy with the help of NN also.

Note:- I had performed all this testing by taking fold=4.
